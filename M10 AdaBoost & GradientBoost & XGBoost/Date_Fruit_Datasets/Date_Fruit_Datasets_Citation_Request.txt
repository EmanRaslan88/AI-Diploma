Abstract: A great number of fruits are grown around the world, 
each of which has various types. 
The factors that determine the type of fruit are the external appearance features such as
 color, length, diameter, and shape. The external appearance of the fruits is 
a major determinant of the fruit type. 
Determining the variety of fruits by looking at their external appearance may 
necessitate expertise, which is time-consuming a
nd requires great effort. The aim of this study is to classify the types 
of date fruit, that are, Barhee, Deglet Nour, Sukkary, Rotab Mozafati, Ruthana, Safawi,
 and Sagai by using three different machine learning methods. In accordance 
with this purpose, 898 images of seven different date fruit types were obtained 
via the computer vision system (CVS). Through image processing techniques, a total of
 34 features, including morphological features, shape, and color, were extracted 
from these images.
